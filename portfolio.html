            <h2>Hello World: I'm Vikram Mangat</h2>
            <p>At 29, my passion for code isn't just a hobby; it's a full-blown obsession. For the past 7 years, I've been building my coding toolkit brick by brick, self-taught style. Youtube, Codecademy, Udemy and Udacity fueled my early journey, equipping me with the fundamentals of Java and XML for basic Android app development. But I wasn't content with just building apps - I wanted to push boundaries.
My curiosity led me down the fascinating rabbit hole of blockchain. Grasping the basics of Solidity, I leveraged the power of the OpenZeppelin library to deploy my own crypto token on the Ethereum network. It was a baptism by fire in decentralized tech, proving my ability to learn complex concepts and dive headfirst into real-world applications.
But that's not all! My thirst for knowledge knows no bounds. Two Python courses later, I found myself importing github Python scripts into my terminal to explore the intriguing world of ethical hacking through Kali Linux and VirtualBox. This hands-on experience honed my problem-solving skills and ability to think critically under pressure.
Now, I'm taking my passion to the next level as a master's student in Software Engineering at the University of Maryland Baltimore County. I'm not just acquiring skills; I'm forging a foundation of theoretical knowledge and professional discipline.
So, who am I? I'm a self-driven learner, a fearless explorer, and a problem-solver. I'm not afraid to get my hands dirty in code, whether it's building apps, deploying tokens, or delving into the intricacies of secure systems. I'm here to learn, to grow, and to contribute my unique skillset to the vibrant world of tech.
Recruiters, are you looking for an entry-level developer or a prompt engineer who's hungry for challenges and brimming with potential? Let's talk!

            <h2>Prompt Engineering: Embracing Google Bard and Generative AI</h2>
           
            <p>My journey as a graduate student a just took a leap forward. While honing my coding skills, I embraced the cutting-edge technology of <a href="https://bard.google.com/chat"> Bard</a> , an AI assistant who became my co-pilot in building this very website. Bard guided me 
                with code templates and nudged me to refine my creative vision, making my development journey faster and more efficient. This collaboration allowed me to focus on the big picture, showcasing my ability to learn new tools and apply them thoughtfully. The result? A polished portfolio that stands as a testament to my 
                dedication and my burgeoning developer skills.</p>

            <h2>The iLiveMindful Website (1000+ Monthly Visitors, 11:56 Average Session Duration)</h2>
            <p>iLiveMindful isn't just a <a href="https://www.ilivemindful.com">website</a>; it's a portal to a healthier you. As a passionate developer, I was entrusted with designing a website that embodies the Mindful Living weight-loss clinic's mission of promoting wellness. My focus was on crafting a user-friendly experience that seamlessly blends informative content with
                 easy access to the clinic's services. Think intuitive navigation, calming aesthetics, and readily available health tips â€“ all seamlessly woven into a digital oasis that guides users towards their wellness goals. The result is a website that not only serves as a contact point but also fosters a thriving community around
                  Mindful Living's philosophy, welcoming over 1000 visitors monthly who spend an average of 11 minutes and 56 seconds exploring its wealth of resources over the past 365 days.</p>

            <h2>From Clinic to Companion: Customizing the Coachcare App (Collaboration with Weight-Loss App Developers)</h2>
            <p>
                The Mindful Living clinic wanted to extend their reach and empower their clients on the go. Enter Coachcare, a leading weight-loss app development company, and me, the bridge between the two. I collaborated closely with Coachcare's programmers to blend their core functionality with Mindful Living's unique touch. We 
                seamlessly integrated the clinic's branding, tailored the diet documentation system to their specific needs, and even showcased their proprietary protein product line within the app. The result? <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ilivemindful/id1438556440">A personalized app </a> that acts as a pocket-sized companion for Mindful Living clients, allowing them to track progress,
                 access valuable dietary guidance, and stay connected to the clinic's supportive community. This collaborative effort with Coachcare has made the app an essential tool for Mindful Living's weight-loss journey, offering their clients a convenient and personalized experience.
